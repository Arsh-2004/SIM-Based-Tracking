# SIM-Based Tracking System with ESP8266/ESP32

This project implements a SIM-based tracking system using the ESP8266 NodeMCU or ESP32 Dev Board. The system tracks the location of a device using a GPS module and transmits the data over the cellular network using a GSM/GPRS module.

## Features

- Real-time GPS tracking
- Cellular network communication
- Low-cost hardware components
- Easy to deploy and configure

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP8266 NodeMCU or ESP32 Dev Board
- SIM800L GSM/GPRS module
- NEO-6M GPS module
- Prepaid SIM card
- USB power bank or battery pack

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Arduino libraries for ESP8266 or ESP32
- TinyGPS++ library for GPS parsing

## Installation

1. Install the Arduino IDE on your computer.
2. Install the necessary board support package for ESP8266 or ESP32 in the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect the hardware components according to the wiring diagram.
4. Open the Arduino sketch file (`tracking_system.ino`) in the Arduino IDE.
5. Configure the firmware settings (e.g., APN, destination phone number) in the sketch file.
6. Compile and upload the sketch to your ESP8266 or ESP32 board.

## Usage

1. Power on the tracking system using a USB power bank or battery pack.
2. Wait for the system to establish communication with the cellular network and acquire GPS fix.
3. The system will continuously track the device's location and transmit the data over the cellular network.
4. Monitor the transmitted data on the receiving end (e.g., server, mobile phone).

# SIM-Based Tracking Project Guide

## Hardware Components:
1. **SIM800 Module**: For GSM/GPRS communication.
2. **ESP8266 NodeMCU**: For interfacing with the SIM800 module and controlling the tracking system.
3. **GPS Module (Optional)**: For obtaining location data if GPS functionality is required.
4. **Antenna**: For GSM/GPRS communication.
5. **SIM Card**: For accessing the cellular network.
6. **Power Supply**: USB power bank, battery pack, or power adapter.

## Wiring Diagram:
1. Connect the SIM800 module to the ESP8266 NodeMCU using serial communication (UART). Connect SIM800's TX to ESP8266's RX and SIM800's RX to ESP8266's TX. Connect GND and VCC pins as well.
2. If using a GPS module, connect it to the ESP8266 NodeMCU following the manufacturer's wiring instructions.

## Firmware Development (Using Arduino IDE for ESP8266):
1. **Install Necessary Libraries**:
   - Install the "SIM800L" library for interfacing with the SIM800 module.
   - If using a GPS module, install the appropriate library for GPS parsing (e.g., TinyGPS++).

2. **Initialize Serial Communication**:
   - Set up serial communication between the ESP8266 NodeMCU and the SIM800 module using the `SoftwareSerial` library.

3. **Configure SIM800 Module**:
   - Send AT commands to configure the SIM800 module, including setting up the APN, enabling GPRS, and attaching to the network.

4. **Retrieve Location Data (Optional)**:
   - If using a GPS module, read and parse location data from the GPS module.

5. **Transmit Data Over Cellular Network**:
   - Send location data (and any additional information) over the cellular network using AT commands.

## Testing and Deployment:
1. **Test the System**: Ensure proper communication with the SIM800 module, GPS module (if applicable), and the cellular network. Test under various conditions to verify reliability and accuracy.
2. **Optimize Power Usage**: Implement power-saving features to minimize power consumption, especially if the system is battery-powered.
3. **Deploy the System**: Once testing is successful, deploy the tracking system in the desired application environment.

## Considerations:
- **Network Coverage**: Ensure adequate cellular network coverage in the deployment area for reliable communication.
- **Data Plan**: Obtain a suitable data plan for the SIM card to avoid unexpected charges.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Adhere to relevant regulations and guidelines regarding the use of cellular communication devices.
